## Description

happy camper is a roadtrip travel app that allows you to save stops from your roadtrip to a map, leave reviews about the pins, and update any information you may have about the stop after visiting. Our motivation behind this app was to create a simple way to save roadtrip stops for later use (ie: when we're planning our next trip!). We built this project because we are all avid travelers and wanted something that was useful for our next adventures. This prevents us from having to save stops down in our Google Maps app or leave for later use in a notepad we can't find when we're planning our next trip. We learned that creating a map app like this is harder than it looks, but hopefully is rewarding!

## Installation

In order to install this project, you can simply clone the code through our repository and run "npm i" in an integrated terminal after opening in Visual Studio Code. After that, simply run "npm run develop" to see the project in a local server. Or, if you're looking for an even easier fix, just click through to our heroku deployment here: ()

## Usage

To use happy camper, first you will need to signup (create an account) and login (if you're a previous user) to see your map data and begin saving pins/stops. 

Once you're logged in, you can drag and scroll to zoom in/out to find your next pin. You can also use the search bar at the top left to search for certain cities and areas, too. 

Double click anywhere on the map to add a new pin, fill out the form with the pins details, and submit. 

If you'd like to update a previous pin you've created, you can click on a pin on the map and update it at the bottom of the popup.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
